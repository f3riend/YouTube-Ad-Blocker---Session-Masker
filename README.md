# YouTube-Ad-Blocker---Session-Masker

**Reason for development:** I normally use Brave and normally it blocks all ads but after July 30, 2024 it stopped working, I did some research on the internet and realized I'm not the only one with this problem, I reinstalled brave to see if maybe I was up to date but the ad blocker was no longer working, so I searched for some ad blockers on google web store and if I log in they don't work, so I decided to develop my own plugin.

Steps
    - Turn off ad blocker for Brave
    - Open developer mode in extensions
    - Click to upload unpacked item
    - Select the gihub folder you downloaded



**Note:** It will block most of the ads but unfortunately not all.
