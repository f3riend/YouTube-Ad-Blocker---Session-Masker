# YouTube-Ad-Blocker---Session-Masker

**Development reason:** I normally use Brave and normally it blocks all ads but after July 30, 2024 it stopped working, I did some research on the internet and realized that I am not the only one having this problem, I reinstalled brave to see if maybe I was up to date but the ad blocker was no longer working, so I searched for some ad blockers on google web store and if I log in they were not working, so I decided to develop my own plugin.

**Note:** It will block most of the ads but not all of them unfortunately.
