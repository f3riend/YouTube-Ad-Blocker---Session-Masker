# YouTube-Ad-Blocker---Session-Masker

**Reason for development:** I normally use Brave and normally it blocks all ads but after July 30, 2024 it stopped working, I did some research on the internet and realized I'm not the only one with this problem, I reinstalled brave to see if maybe I was up to date but the ad blocker was no longer working, so I searched for some ad blockers on google web store and they don't work if I log in, so I decided to develop my own plugin.

**Steps:**
- Turn off ad blocker for Brave
- Turn on developer mode in extensions
- Click to load the unpackaged product
- Select the gihub folder you downloaded



**Note:** It will block most of the ads but unfortunately not all.

In case of ads, reloading the page will resolve the situation, I recommend waiting a while after installing the plugin.


Brave has made the necessary update as of August 2, 2024, but you can still use it if you want.
